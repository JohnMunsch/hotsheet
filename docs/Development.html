<h1>HotSheet Development</h1>

<h2>Building HotSheet</h2>

<p>Building HotSheet couldn't be much easier. Just download the source tree and
install Ant (a link to the software is provided below). Then go to the directory
you loaded the HotSheet source code into and type <code>ant</code>. That will cause
Ant to build the default target and put the results into the build directory. All 
the JAR files (what you would actually distribute) will be put into the build/lib
directory.</p>

<p>I normally deploy HotSheet using Java Web Start from my website. The JNLP 
file used to do that deployment is in the misc folder and you'll need to edit it
if you want to do deployment the same way. All the information you may
need with regard to Java Web Start or signing your application for release using
Java Web Start is available in the links section at the bottom of this readme.</p>

<p>There is already a target in the Ant build file to sign the JAR file for
distribution via Java Web Start but you'll have to use your own keystore and
sign the jar yourself if you want to do that. Remember that all the other JAR
files that make up your application must also be signed using the same key in 
order for Java Web Start to approve running the application on the clients 
machine so you'll need to sign all the JAR files in the lib directory once as
well.</p>

<p>If you just want to run HotSheet from the command line you can use the 
following command to do so:</p>

<div align="center">
<code>ant HotSheet</code>
</div>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>At present the development documentation is sparse. I hope to improve
that in the future. In the meantime you can execute the command <code>ant javadoc</code>
and the API documentation will be created.</p>

<a href="apidoc/index.html">API Documentation (Note: This link will not work until instructions in previous paragraph are followed)</a>

<h2>RSS Development Examples</h2>

<p>If you have followed the instructions to build HotSheet given above you can 
run the demonstration programs HelloRSS, HTMLBox and the newest demonstration
ListenersTest. This new example demonstrates the basics of using the ItemStore and 
ChannelStore objects as well as the newly added events and listeners code:</p>

<p>To run a particular application just use the command <code>ant &lt;program 
name&gt;</code>. For example, <code>ant HelloRSS</code> or 
<code>ant ListenersTest</code>.</p>

<p>The full sourcecode to these example programs is provided in the
src/com/johnmunsch/demo directory. Just read the comments in each one and it 
should get you started pretty easily.</p>

<h2>Directory Structure</h2>

<pre>
    |---<em>Project Root</em>
        |---build.xml - ant configuration file
        |---<em>build</em> - generated files (this directory is created during the build)
        |   |---<em>classes</em> - destination for compiled java code
        |   |---<em>lib</em> - the JAR files that make up the compiled program
        |---docs - non javadoc generated documentation (specs, etc.)
        |---lib - third party libraries
        |---misc - files needed for building or distributing the program
        |---src - project source code (see code organization for details)
        |---ReadMe.html - this file
</pre>

<h2>Code Organization</h2>

<p>There's not a lot to the code organization of HotSheet. The RSS code 
library is contained entirely in the src/com/johnmunsch/rss directory. This is
the only code you need if you are developing another program to use the RSS 
library.</p>

<p>The HotSheet code is contained in src/com/johnmunsch/hotsheet and it relies
on the RSS library code as well as the code under edu/stanford/ejalbert which is
used as backup browser launching code when HotSheet is run from the command line
(i.e. the JNLP code from Java Web Start that is normally used to launch the
browser is unavailable).</p>

<p>Lastly there is the code in src/com/johnmunsch/demo which is demonstration
code that shows how to program using the RSS library.</p>

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>

<p>HotSheet doesn't handle international character sets yet. For example, these
channels can be retrieved successfully (and their links work) but they do not
display correctly in HotSheet:</p>

<ul>
<li>http://www.hyuki.com/tf/tf.xml</li>
<li>http://www.nsg.co.jp/nbb/ss/joy/idxxml.rss0.9.xml</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to James Carlyle on the syndication mailing list for the links.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>The following are links to resources that may be helpful (or necessary) to
do development using the HotSheet code.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a></dt>
<dd>Repository for the source code, bug lists, wish lists, etc. for current
and future development of HotSheet.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.javasoft.com/j2se/">Sun Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) </a></dt>
<dd>You will see a link to download the latest version of the J2SE SDK on this
page (it was version 1.3 at the time of this writing). At a minimum you must
have this or another Java 2 compatible SDK in order to build the code.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a></dt>
<dd>The best build tool out there for Java projects. Performs the same types of
functions that developers used to use Unix <i>make</i> for but does it using
software that is written in Java (and thus portable to the same machines your
programs are portable to) and it uses an XML based build file rather than the
often obscure syntax of <i>make</i> files.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a></dt>
<dd>NetBeans and its commercial counterpart Forte are integrated development
environments (IDEs) for compiling, running, debugging, etc. Java projects.
NetBeans 3.1 and 3.2 were used for all the original development work on 
HotSheet. Note: You do not have to have NetBeans in order to build or do any
further work on HotSheet. As long as you have the source code, a Java 
Development Kit (JDK), and Ant you can build the program and extend it any way
you please. If all you intend to do is rip parts out to include in a program
of your own then you may not even need Ant.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/xml_jaxp.html">Java APIs for XML Processing (JAXP)</a></dt>
<dd>JAXP is a Java library for reading and writing XML files. HotSheet uses it
to handle the reading of RSS files which are XML based. Unless you need the
documentation for JAXP you do not need to download anything from this site
because all the JAXP libraries HotSheet needs are included in the source and 
binary distributions.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmousewheel/">JMouseWheel</a></dt>
<dd>Enables mousewheel support for Windows users before the feature becomes
standard in the Sun JDK 1.4.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://browserlauncher.sourceforge.net/">BrowserLauncher</a></dt>
<dd>BrowserLauncher does just what the name suggests. It provides cross-platform
support for launching a browser and directing it to a particular URL.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/projects/bsf">The Bean Scripting Framework</a></dt>
<dd>BSF gives you support for many many scripting languages with minimal effort.
The stable of languages that are compatible with it is steadily increasing too.</dd>
