Note: Before you read anything else, note that this is a circa 2000-2001 project I wrote when I was first learning Java.
It does pretty much everything wrong. A prime example is that I used serialization to store pretty much everything. It was
quick, but it shouldn't have survived for more than a day or two without being replaced with something else. Especially
later on when embeddable databases for Java projects became commonplace.

In general, I wouldn't recommend taking much of anything from this code, however, it's been hosted for a long time at
Sourceforge and is still downloaded regularly for some unknown reason. Seriously, do yourself a favor and find some 
more modern code to imitate. And if what you need is the RSS library from it, go take a look at ROME instead 
(https://rometools.jira.com/wiki/display/ROME/Home). It's not really getting updated anymore either, but at least it 
was much more fully developed than my much earlier project.

Also note, this IN NO WAY, represents my skill level with Java after having worked with it for more than a decade. This is
the first few months of learning a new language and library in what was effectively the dawn of time before the cool
libraries and language features we take for granted today.

Thanks,
